## Extending

### Ontology extension

In contrast to [=ontology alignment=], [=ontology extending=] is a way to extend an [=ontology=] with another one. They are closely related to each other, but they serve a different purpose. In this second an overview is given of what an [=ontology extending=] is and what [=ontology extensions=] compose of.

### General theory

To be clear, there is not a generally excepted theory for expanding or linking [=ontologies=], because it is in the nature of [[RDF-schema]] and [LinkedData][LD] to do so. It is designed for distributed data or [=ontologies=] to work together and to be interlinked. In this best practice it is proposed to see the extension as a separate model or graph.

>DEF
><dfn data-lt="extending">Ontology extending</dfn> refers to the process of extending or enhancing an existing [=ontology=]. This is often needed to reuse concepts and making [=ontologies=] work together. This concept is the base for [LinkedData][LD].

>DEF
>An <dfn data-lt="extension|extensions|ontology extension">Ontology extension</dfn> is a set of correspondences between two or more [=ontologies=]. The [=ontology extension=] is the output of the [=ontology extending=] process.
